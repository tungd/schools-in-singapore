Talented dancers are given a platform to enhance their skills and develop holistically through overseas exchange programmes.<br /><br />Values in Action (VIA)<br />The Values in Action (VIA) in BPPS are rich learning experiences to inculcate active citizenship and civic responsibility among our students. VIA in BPPS begins with students learning how to care for oneself and progressively spiral up to caring for the local community. While the students celebrate their achievements of carrying out the VIA tasks, they also reflect on the values they have put into practice. <br />At the end of six years in BPPS, we believe that with the experiences that our students have gone through, they would be socially responsible citizens who contribute meaningfully to the community."
