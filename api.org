      "philosophy": "West Spring Primary was established in 2014. We are guided by our philosophy that a positive learning environment that provides opportunities for students to experience big and small successes can be attained through meaningful learning and character development opportunities. This belief is captured through the school song that encourages students to be \"thankful for this day [where they] will have joy in [their] hearts and love in [their] souls as [they] work towards [their] goals\". We believe students enjoy coming to school when they are able to experience small and big successes. <br /><br />Through this belief, the school's approach to teaching and learning includes taking a refreshing approach to make learning a joy, engaging and effective in mastering the skills and developing the disposition and attitude that will keep them open to lifelong learning.  <br /><br />The students' joy in coming to school is due to the hard work of the school community of committed teachers, staff and very supportive parents and partners who believe in the school's vision. The school community aspires for excellence in our pursuits. <br />",

This approach engages students through Cognitive PLAY, Physical PLAY, Object PLAY, Dramatic PLAY and ICT PLAY. This approach helps a child move from kindergarten to lower primary and continue to flourish.<br /><br />Building upon the PLAY approach in lower primary, the school provides an integrated platform for students to develop critical and inventive thinking skills through the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) approach to teaching and learning. The early introduction of scientific and engineering thinking through the use of LEGO and Scientists@PLAY in Primary 1 and 2 provides the foundation on which the STEM approach builds upon. All Primary 3 and 4 students experience coding for fun as part of their modular CCA among other programmes that allow them a hands-on approach to problem solving and inventive thinking.<br /><br />CHARM - Character Matters - is the school's signature character development programme for all students. These values-based lessons include engaging activities for students to visualise and experience how to demonstrate good values and behaviour. Other Character and Citizenship Education programmes include the following:<br />-Six Kinds of Best hands-on programme based on David Koutsoukis' vision of helping young people develop good values and contribute to society<br />-ACTIVATE (Action to Inculcate the Values of Teamwork) to help students develop good habits for life. This is nurtured when students clean up after themselves at recess and at the end of the school day and also at home with their family.<br />-Friend of Singa Ambassadors to promote kindness among schoolmates<br />-Cultivating Leaders of Values (CLOVE) programme to develop our students holistically using the Jim Kouzes and Barry Posner's The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership<br />"

This enriched curriculum is built on the regular curriculum.<br /><br />In this school, we believe that every child has potential and is an agent of change; every West Viewan is a Leader. Hence, we sensitise our pupils as caring individuals to the developments taking place around them and educate them for the future through The Leader In Me programme. Content from The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People forms that key component of the overall student learning and development process in the school. It reminds our pupils to embrace personal responsibility to become good in their endeavour. It requires them to understand the importance of learning and gaining knowledge for personal growth, having a growth mindset and commitment to learning.

      "philosophy": "Grown from an initial student population of 300 in the founding year in 1951, Red Swastika School has established itself as a school recognised for its holistic education and emphasis  on character development anchored on the Xingzhi culture. <br /> <br />The Red Swastika School was founded by the World Red Swastika Society (Singapore Administration Centre), a charitable organization. As an extension of its charitable mandate and to achieve the noble objective of transforming people through education, the Society built a school on a site at Somapah Road in Changi. The over three acres piece of land was donated by the then President of the Society, Mr Quek Shin, who saw the need to provide free primary education for the poor and to aid in the promotion of education in the outlying areas. Originally known as \"Wan Tzu School\", the school was later renamed \"Red Swastika School\". The foundation stone was laid at the school opening ceremony on 13th January 1951. The school moved to the present site at Bedok North Avenue 3 in 1981 and became a Special Assistance Plan school in 1990.<br /><br />The school believes in the educational philosophy espoused by Mr Tao Xingzhi, a biculturally educated scholar commonly praised as the modern Confucius. Staff and students strive to build a Xingzhi Culture of \"Doing is the beginning of knowledge. Knowledge is perfected when the deed is completed. Do, so that you can know.  After you know, do it again.  Let your deed measure up to your knowledge.\" Students work towards being grounded in the strong values of Care, Magnanimity, Respect, Honesty, Resilience, Responsibility, Helpfulness, Leadership and Teamwork, to become the exemplary Three Littles- Little Friend, Little Master and Little Teacher.",
